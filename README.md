# Memory-Match-Game
Desgined and Implemented a simple memory match game.

# Functionality 
Implemented the PApplet processing library to build the Graphical User Interface and interact with the player. The program responds to mouse-based
input or key-pressed.The game is a one player memory game in which 12 cards are initially laid face down on a surface.
Each turn, the player selects two faced down cards, which are then flipped over. If the two cards
match, they remain faced up. Otherwise, they are both flipped back to face down. When the
player successfully turns all the cards up, the program will declare him a Winner of the game.

# Example
